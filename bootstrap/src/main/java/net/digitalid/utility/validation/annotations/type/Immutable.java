/**
 * This annotation indicates that the objects of the annotated class are immutable.
 * <p>
 * An object is considered immutable, if its representation (usually the data that is included in its block) is fixed.
 * Other objects that are not fully part of its representation but can nonetheless be reached through its fields may still be mutable.
 * <p>
 * It should always be safe to share immutable objects between various instances and threads.
 * However, it is in general not guaranteed that the hash of immutable objects stays the same.
 * In other words, an immutable object is only conceptually immutable but its values may change.
 * (This is the case with references to persons, which remain constant but can still be merged.)
